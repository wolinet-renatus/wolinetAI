/** Pure guided-setup flow helpers for the terminal onboarding.
 *
 * The TUI first-run and `/setup` walk-through is architecture-first: choose an
 * arrangement, then a model for each role, then review (optional Advanced/Shunt).
 * These helpers encode the sequential transition rules so they can be
 * unit-tested without a renderer. The OpentUI components in `tui/onboarding.tsx`
 * call them for choices that must stay consistent; they are NOT shared with the
 * browser client, which has its own Onboarding flow.
