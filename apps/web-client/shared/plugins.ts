// Plugin packages (design note 4.4): install-time trust. A package is a LOCAL

// every installed item is recorded with provenance (kind + exact target +
// sha256 of the installed content) so uninstall removes exactly what the
// plugin owns and never a file the user modified. Git URLs are OUT OF SCOPE in
// v1: users clone first — the installer never touches the network.

/** One provenance record. `target` is an exact workspace-relative file path
 * (skills/commands) or a settings key (mcp/hooks). `hash` is the sha256 of the
 * installed content: file text for files, canonical JSON for settings entries
 * (mcp hashes EXCLUDE `enabled` so connecting a server later does not strand
 * the entry at uninstall). */
