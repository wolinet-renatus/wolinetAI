# Permission rules

Permission rules let you decide, per tool and per argument pattern, whether a tool call is allowed without asking, always asks, or is denied outright — before the session's general permission mode applies. Rules narrow or confirm authority; they never widen it. Plan mode's read-only ceiling, project profile tool allowlists, and the researcher tool ceiling all still apply first.

## Choose an approval mode

- **Ask first** reviews edits, commands, connected actions, and external paths.
- **Allow project edits** automatically permits guarded workspace file edits. Commands and new external access still ask unless separately authorized.
- **Allow all tools** (previously Full access) permits all available tools, including pending actions. Explicit ask/deny rules and mode/profile limits remain in force.

When a task pauses for approval, choose **Allow all tools** directly on the approval card (**5** in the terminal). This resumes pending actions and remembers the mode for this session and its workers across turns and restarts. You can also change it from `/permissions` or the browser composer. **Remember for session/project** only approves the displayed scope; it does not enable all tools.

To use this mode for new sessions in the project, choose **Permissions → Allow all tools** during `/setup` or browser setup, then save. Permissions are visible in quick setup too.

Internal researcher, Sidekick, Team, Expert, and LiteFusion handoffs run automatically within the selected architecture. The worker's actual actions follow the parent session policy. Explicit delegation rules still apply. Stopping the session's own shell jobs is automatic; read-only profiles do not acquire shell controls.

Approval cards show the action, target, and scope before you choose **Allow once**, **Remember for session**, **Remember for this project**, or **Deny**. A forced ask rule offers only one-time approval or denial. Session grants apply across turns and workers; forks do not inherit them. Project grants are an explicit persistent choice and can be cleared in Settings → Permissions → Project access.

Shell grants cover the exact command, working directory, and confinement posture. They never authorize all `bash` commands. External file grants cover the tool at the resolved path. Workspace file-tool grants cover that file tool in the workspace. MCP grants bind the reviewed connection and tool catalog: explicitly remembered read tools can handle different read arguments; mutable/unknown tools require the same arguments. Read-only hints never approve a call by themselves.

Version 0.1.20 retires legacy grant hashes so old broad shell/MCP approvals cannot silently become new grants. Your saved permission mode is preserved.

The CLI supports `--ask`, `--allow-edits`, and `--auto`. Interactive `run` offers once/session/project approval choices. Noninteractive runs use existing project grants and rules; unresolved approvals are denied.

## Command confinement

Enable **workspace command confinement** for an idle session in Settings → Permissions → Project access. With Allow project edits, confined commands run automatically; Ask first still prompts. The OS restricts reads to workspace/runtime resources, writes to the workspace and a private temporary directory, and prevents host network access. Protected files and app state remain excluded. `verify` and background jobs use the same launcher.

macOS uses Seatbelt and Linux uses bubblewrap. A missing or unavailable backend fails closed. An agent can request `sandbox:"off"` when broader access is needed; that is a distinct command scope and follows normal approval rules. There is no automatic unrestricted retry. See [command confinement](design-sandbox.md) for limits.

## Where rules live

- **App rules** — Settings → Permissions. Stored with your other app settings.
- **Project rules** — a `.litespeed/permissions.json` file in the workspace, with the same shape:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "rules": [
    { "tool": "bash", "decision": "allow", "patterns": ["git status", "npm test", "npm run **"] },
    { "tool": "write_file", "decision": "deny", "patterns": ["**/*.env", ".env*"] },
    { "tool": "task", "decision": "allow" }
  ]
}
```

Project deny/ask rules apply immediately to future turns. Project allow rules require explicit review in Settings → Permissions; approval binds the exact file contents and must be renewed after edits. App rules are explicitly saved settings.

Rules for a turn are captured when your message is accepted, together with the session's other policy. Editing rules changes future turns, never a turn already running. An invalid project file is ignored with a visible notice rather than silently treated as empty — and it never blocks the turn.

## How a decision is made

For each tool call:

1. An explicit **deny** anywhere wins. The call is refused without a prompt — even in automatic-approval mode, and even when the tool was previously granted "Always allow".
2. An explicit **ask** forces a prompt every time — also overriding automatic approval and remembered grants.
3. Otherwise the ordinary policy applies: reads inside the workspace run, automatic mode or a remembered grant approves, and an explicit **allow** rule approves without asking.
4. No matching rule falls back to the session's permission mode.

Project rules outrank app rules at equal severity. Within one source, the most severe matching decision wins. Rule order never matters — there is no "last rule wins" trap where a catch-all silently revokes earlier rules.

A tool denied by a pattern-free rule is removed from the model's advertised tools for that turn entirely. Rules can target exact connected (`mcp_`) tool names; `task` rules authorize or refuse launching a researcher but never widen what the researcher can do.

## Pattern matching

A rule with no patterns matches every call of its tool. Patterns match the tool's sensitive argument: the command text for `bash`, the supplied path for file tools (relative to the workspace or absolute), the URL for `web_fetch`, the pattern/path for `glob`/`grep`.

- A **wildcard-free bash pattern is a command prefix at a word boundary**: `git status` matches `git status` and `git status --short`, not `git statusx`.
- For other tools a wildcard-free pattern must match exactly.
- `*` stays within one unit: in paths it does not cross `/`; in bash commands it spans words and flags but never shell control operators (`;`, `&&`, `|`, backticks, `$(...)`, redirects). `npm run *` covers `npm run lint -- --fix` but not `npm run lint && curl evil.example`.
- `**` matches anything, and a leading `**/` also matches zero directories — `**/*.secret` covers both a root-level `deploy.secret` and `config/api.secret`.
- A bash command containing shell control operators is never auto-allowed through a wildcard pattern; it prompts instead, unless an exact wildcard-free pattern equals the full command.

## Access outside the workspace

File tools accept absolute paths and parent-relative paths such as `../litespeed/package.json`. In Ask mode, even an external read asks for approval in the main conversation, including calls from researchers and sidekicks. Plan mode permits these reads but continues to block writes and shell commands. Auto mode and matching allow rules can approve external access; explicit ask and deny rules retain precedence.

The prompt shows the resolved external target. “Remember for session/project” remembers that tool and target in this session; it does not grant access to other external paths or reuse a workspace-only grant. Search grants bind to the selected directory for that search tool. File rules are also checked against the resolved external path, so symlink aliases cannot bypass a matching deny. A target that changes while approval is pending must be submitted again.

External writes show their diff in the tool transcript but are not part of workspace Undo/Redo. Existing credential, hard-link, and `.git` write protections remain. The UI file browser and attachment endpoints remain confined to the session workspace; this extension is issued by the runner only after tool approval.

## Honest limits

Command pattern matching is a convenience on the command text, not a shell parser or a sandbox. An unrestricted command still runs with your local user's full capabilities, and a denied pattern only blocks commands that match it textually. Prefer deny rules for clear, narrow cases and treat allow rules as a way to reduce prompts for commands you already trust. Automatic-approval mode remains a broad opt-in; explicit deny and ask rules are the tools that constrain it.

## Optional Shunt

Shunt’s reader authorizes each source as `read_file`; its writer authorizes the generated target as `write_file`. Existing grants, rules, profile ceilings, external-path checks, hooks and sidecars apply. Its large-read routing hint is not a denial; `direct_reason` is an agent choice that preserves normal permission checks. See [Shunt permissions and recovery](shunt.md#permissions-and-recovery).

## Setup and lifecycle

Project hooks have a separate visible trust control; trusting project allow rules does not enable executable hooks. Plugin hooks install disabled and can be reviewed/enabled individually as app-wide executables. Already configured app hooks keep their state. Hooks and sidecars run outside command confinement under their own explicit setup authority.

MCP import offers disabled import or **Import and connect selected** after reviewing commands/endpoints. Source and configuration revisions are rechecked before execution. Failed connections are reported and never silently retried. Environment credential values are not displayed in the plan.

MCP scripts pause their execution budget while waiting for approval. Denial/cancellation still stops the script; already completed external effects are not undone. Identical sidecar arguments do not trigger a redundant second approval.
