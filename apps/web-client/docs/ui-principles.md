# UI principles

Litespeed should give most of its space and attention to the conversation and the next action.

- Show a state once, where it matters. A running task, approval, or question replaces the generic working indicator. Do not repeat it in the byline, header, and footer.
- Show token totals only after a turn completes. Keep request context estimates out of ordinary messages; expose the latest snapshot in Session actions after completion.
- Prefer compact rows and modest gaps. Add a bordered panel only when it establishes a useful boundary; avoid panels inside panels.
- Keep recovery and errors visible when actionable. Put occasional controls such as undo and redo in Session actions, with explanations at the point of use.
- Keep the composer focused on writing and sending. Avoid permanent instructional footers and labels announcing a default state.
- Make common settings fit a small dialog. Scroll long model or skill lists independently; disclose advanced settings and instruction previews on demand.
- Keep readable type, keyboard navigation, accessible labels, focus indicators, and usable touch targets. Density should come from removing repetition and padding.
- Model reasoning preferences belong to each provider/model pair in the session and should survive switching roles and models. Provider default means no override is sent.

- Keep one indentation grid under a response. Prose and every activity label share the same text edge; an expandable row places its chevron in the gutter before it. A live tool row, the collapsed step summary it becomes, and the text they belong to must not sit at three different depths.
- Render streaming markdown as markdown. A half-arrived emphasis pair is completed for display so the terminal never shows literal `**` for a moment and never reflows the paragraph when the closer lands. Completion applies only to the trailing paragraph, never inside a code fence, and never to a settled response, which always renders its real source.
- Keep activity anchored to the message that initiated it. Show live tool calls and a quiet thinking indicator; finished reasoning expands inline on request. Combine consecutive tool-only rounds into one compact block and collapse it when the assistant adds text or finishes. Text and user/system messages are boundaries. Show an error on the affected action, without a generic issue tally. Give every worker or expert a numbered card immediately, including queued calls, with one assignment title and its own status. In the TUI, keep the full worker transcript in the conversation's shared scroll area; follow new activity unless the reader scrolls up.
- Use neutral colors for prose, headings, and completed activity. Reserve accents for current work and actions, and error colors for actual failures. Show actor headings when control changes, and keep the task sidebar focused on each agent's latest checklist.
- Open the workspace panel by default on desktop and remember the reader’s choice. Keep it closed by default on narrow screens.
- Project profiles belong in Settings, never in the composer. Show a single mode control and the main model; keep the sidekick's full configuration in the model picker.
- Do not confuse density with tiny type. Use readable answer text, quiet table rules, and consistent alignment; reserve stronger styling for user actions.

- Configure models in decision order: architecture dropdown with one-line descriptions, searchable dropdowns for the selected roles, then a separate optional Planner model section. Recommend Sidekick Fusion during first-run setup and label LiteFusion experimental; explain the model suited to every role and keep Single model available. Preserve saved workspace choices.
- Project profiles use the same Settings navigation and form dimensions as other sections, with visible creation/editing controls. Saving a definition and applying it to the current session are separate actions.
- Keep the sidebar short: New session, the session list, and a Settings control in the bottom workspace row. Search stays available through the keyboard palette.

- Concurrent workers show compact task/model/effort/status/current-action rows. Never auto-expand several worker transcripts. Inspect one worker at a time, retain attempts across escalation, and restore the conversation draft and scroll on return. Sidekick retains its single inline flow.
